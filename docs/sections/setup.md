## Installation and setup

You can download the compiled YAML Overlay Tool `Yot` binary from the repository's releases page [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/yaml-overlay-tool/releases).

* Be sure to download the appropriate release for your system's architecture and operating system.
* It is recommended to move the binary into your path, such as `/usr/local/bin/yot` or `/usr/bin` for Linux and Unix-based systems.

Run the `Yot` command once the `Yot` binary is installed to a path in your system's `$PATH`
